Wordle is a popular online game where players try to guess a five-letter word in a limited number of attempts. The rules of the game are simple:

The game generates a random five-letter word at the beginning of each round.

Players have six attempts to guess the word correctly. Each incorrect guess counts as one attempt.

After each guess, the game indicates which letters are correct and in the right position with a green square, and which letters are correct but in the wrong position with a yellow square.

Players can use this feedback to make more informed guesses and narrow down the possibilities.

The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word, or when they run out of attempts without guessing the word.

Once the game ends, the player can either start a new round with a new word, or share their score and challenge friends to beat it.

The goal is to guess the word in as few attempts as possible and improve your score over time.
